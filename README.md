# steps

Random scraping several well-known peoples from wikipedia whose lifetimes cover our A.D. history.

I start wondering how many peoples are "related" to our history while watching [T.P.Bon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Patrol_Bon). Most of us can be "erased" from history, like a step in the sand. Or maybe as the saying goes, "äººç”Ÿä»£ä»£æ— ç©·å·²ï¼Œæ±Ÿæœˆå¹´å¹´æœ›ç›¸ä¼¼" (Life goes on endlessly from generation to generation, the river and moon are similar year after year), all of us are just an insignificant step in the river of time.

The timeline drew by this tiny project only last for 2000 years. It's just a very small piece of the whole history. But it's still interesting to see how people run through these 2000 years. And it won't be too many people to draw.

Thanks to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/), I can easily fetch and process the well maintained data and render them here.
